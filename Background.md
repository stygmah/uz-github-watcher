### Online references:

Most of the sites I use as references are [Medium](https://medium.com/) articles about the topics I'm interested at a given time, but recently I have grown fond of [.cult by Honeypot](https://cult.honeypot.io/). Although it is not very technical, it has some great documentaries and articles about the developer scene nowadays.
I should mention that I was a member of [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for a long time, and that is what I mainly used as a reference. I still go back to the youtube channel as they have some short tutorials about new technologies, for example, I recently learned GraphQL thanks to one of the tutorials that popped up on my youtube front-page.

Apart from those, I am subscribbed and participate in several dev subrediits such as:
* [r/WebDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)
* [r/IndieDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/)
* [r/coding](https://www.reddit.com/r/coding/)
* [r/Angular](https://www.reddit.com/r/angular/)
* [r/Javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript)

### 4 Articles that caught my attention recently

[Vue.js mini documentary - .Cult by honeypot]()
I found it to be a very inspiring story. The fact that the success of a single developer is due to trying to solve the problems of the two main javascript frameworks/libraries by getting the best of both world really teaches you that the key to success is solving real problems and improving products. Got me very interested in vue too

[GraphQL mini documentary - .Cult by honeypot]()
The same reason as the previous mini documentary. It got me very interested in GraphQL too, and this time I went through and learned the basics shortly after.

[Whats is Deno and will it replace Node.js? - Fernando Doglio](https://blog.bitsrc.io/what-is-deno-and-will-it-replace-nodejs-a13aa1734a74)
Node.js has many flaws but I think the swiftness in which things can be built and scale  makes up for it in many cases. I found it interesting that Deno tries to fix some of those flaws so this article was very informative about it as there is still too little stuff around about it. 
Although I finished the article not really convinced about Deno, it has some weird decisions in my opinion. For starters, I am not really shure about the fact that uses cdn links rather than npm packages...

[Observer pattern in C# - One wheel studio ](https://onewheelstudio.com/blog/2020/7/24/observer-pattern-c-events)
On my free time I am developing a video game. I learned about game development just about a year ago and loved it. While developing a videogame things get really messy really fast, so I try to keep the best practices, as far as I can/know. One thing that really helped me while developing Angular apps was RxJS and the subject/observer pattern. I was wondering how to apply it for my game so I did my research (It is in C# using the Unity game engine). This article really made it clear. I am still transitioning the project to this new reactive way of communicating between entities but so far it has made it way more manageable. Videogames usually have a lot more entities or instances doing stuff or communicating than web development, so this will make my work much easier in the future.

### Public projects I have participated:

[MediaPro Exhibitions](https://mediaproexhibitions.com/)
[Kermovite Defenders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGQweKOuvPA&ab) - First videogame I ever did, it took 4 months. Not too proud of it but it taught me a lot. This is just the trailer because I pulled it out of the web.
